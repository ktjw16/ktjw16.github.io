            Our project aims to build and silicon-prove a chip framework that will support a continuous cycle of chip designs, or “tape outs,”
            ready for fabrication. The project’s overall goal is to give interested students experience in chip design and fabrication.
            The framework we design will provide space for multiple small projects and the ability to run each independently. The project modules will
            be created by a co-curricular team of students ranging from freshmen to seniors. By breaking the design process into smaller, less complex
            subprojects, students will be able to complete modules within a semester. Each module will be fabricated and synthesized as a hard macro
            that can be used in our framework.

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
