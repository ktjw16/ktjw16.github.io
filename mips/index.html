            In this project, we created a MIPS processor using VHDL, a hardware description programming language.
            Our proecessor was able to execute 32 MIPS assembly instructions, and we built 2 main versions of this processor:
            one that performs each instruction in a single clock cycle, and a 5-stage pipeline processor that can handle
            multiple instructions simultaneously in one clock cycle. The main goal of this project was to create a functional processor
            that works as fast and efficiently as possible, and our processor was able to attain a frequency of 49 MHz.

              Full Width Image:

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
